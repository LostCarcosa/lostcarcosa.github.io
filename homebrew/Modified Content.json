These elves are ostracized from elven society, and some elves even view this as a form of murder. These elves in turn consider the cycle a curse that roots their species firmly in the past. Although they can prevent their past selves from emerging in their psyche, they are powerless to force their descendents to do the same to themselves."

Historically, they have dwelt within the earth- sometimes maintaining trade relations with local communities, exchanging ore for food, but are as a whole fairly self-sufficient, and rarely felt the need to engage with surface affairs. The dwarves on the continent are loosely unified into a single empire known as the Deep Kingdom, ruled by the Buried King. However, each dwarven city is essentially under the control of its own local ruler, and the King exerts only guiding influence on other cities.",
							"Dwarven societies are generally found underneath great mountains, and consist of deep and grand undercities, built far below the earth. The Deep Kingdom is itself splintered into multiple cities and settlements, connected by an extensive series of tunnels. However, underground travel is usually limited to necessary usage, such as trade or communication, as travel is as dangerous underground as it is on the surface.",
							"Dwarves are the originators of rune magic, the art of embedding mystical powers into material objects through the use of precisely-crafted runes. Dwarven society is less hostile to the use of magic than human society, and runes are used heavily in dwarven architecture and technology.",

Surface-dwellers have learned to exercise heavy caution when dealing with dwarven cuisine. Fermented foods also feature quite heavily in dwarven cooking, as a practical means of prepration and preservation.",
							"It's also generally pretty hard to cultivate large livestock, but dwarves do maintain insect farms as a source of protein. Some larger wurm-type insectoids are even used as burrowing aides, sometimes, and dwarves have used selective breeding to get a species of mole to an impressive size, using them primarily as sources of labor (and in death, fur).",

Their societies as a whole use very little light, and what they do use is mostly variants of glow wurms or derivative substances. Fire is rarely used for heat (smoke is dangerous when ventilation is limited); dwarves instead use geothermal heat, and many societies are built around or near hot springs.

Surface-dwelling dwarves are left in a difficult position, struggling to be accepted by both human culture and their own. When making a dwarf character, consider how your character navigates this cultural divide."

Northlanders prefer to take care of their own and leave others to do their same, so two Northland clans that meet either give each other a wide berth, or throw themselves into combat against each other to fend the other off. On very rare occasions, however, a single individual manages to rise up and unite multiple clans under the same cause, taking on the title of Jarl. This happens primarily in times of existential crisis, when the survival of all Northlanders are threatened- but the rise of a Jarl inevitably bodes poorly for the rest of the continent, as a united North inevitably turns their gaze down south."

						"There's a certain dilemma when it comes to death in 5e- namely that although we want the risk of death to be present in difficult combats, we also don't {@i really} want player characters to die (too often)- frequent death messes with the story, disrupts roleplay, cuts off plot threads, and trivializes death.",
						"Oftentimes we compensate by using stakes that don't involve PC death- losing doesn't mean you {@i die} but rather you fail in an important objective. This isn't universally applicable, however, and still runs into the problem that 5e doesn't have a solid failstate in combat other than the TPK (or at least the \"everybody is unconscious\" state, which on average kills about half the party anyway).",
						"So the mortality system is intended to first allow for a risk of death, without relying on DM mercy, but also to keep death from being too common. A 1/6 chance of dying at 3 death saves isn't that big, but it's large enough that it's a very real possibility. Most of the time, instead of dying, a character suffers a lingering wound, which requires time and care to heal.",
						"This system also works to avoid players lying on the ground unconscious, and keeps them in the battle- which means they can keep helping, but also means they're at greater risk. This means that although players will stay conscious longer, they're also more susceptible to being knocked out of the battle entirely, as enemies will continue attacking them. This is {@i probably} okay- in the worst case it's not that different from being stabbed to death while unconscious anyway.",
						"Negative hit points is a ruleset that will need to be watched carefully. In theory, the goal is to incentivize healing players who are at low hit points to give them a 'buffer' against negative hp, and to prevent low amounts of healing from being able to easily reset death saves (which is a large reason why 5e death saves are so non-threatening). In practice, negative hp may become too negative to heal (i.e if a low hp player endures a full dragon's breath), given 5e's rather conservative approach toward healing. We'll see if it becomes a problem."
