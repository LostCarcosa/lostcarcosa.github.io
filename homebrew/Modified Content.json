The dwarves on the continent are loosely unified into a single empire known as the Deep Kingdom, ruled by the Buried King. However, each dwarven city is essentially under the control of its own local ruler, and the King exerts only guiding influence on other cities.",

The Deep Kingdom is itself splintered into multiple cities and settlements, connected by an extensive series of tunnels. However, underground travel is usually limited to necessary usage, such as trade or communication, as travel is as dangerous underground as it is on the surface.",

Surface-dwellers have learned to exercise heavy caution when dealing with dwarven cuisine. Fermented foods also feature quite heavily in dwarven cooking, as a practical means of prepration and preservation.",

Some larger wurm-type insectoids are even used as burrowing aides, sometimes, and dwarves have used selective breeding to get a species of mole to an impressive size, using them primarily as sources of labor (and in death, fur).",

Surface-dwelling dwarves are left in a difficult position, struggling to be accepted by both human culture and their own.

						"Oftentimes we compensate by using stakes that don't involve PC death- losing doesn't mean you {@i die} but rather you fail in an important objective. This isn't universally applicable, however, and still runs into the problem that 5e doesn't have a solid failstate in combat other than the TPK (or at least the \"everybody is unconscious\" state, which on average kills about half the party anyway).",
						"So the mortality system is intended to first allow for a risk of death, without relying on DM mercy, but also to keep death from being too common. A 1/6 chance of dying at 3 death saves isn't that big, but it's large enough that it's a very real possibility. Most of the time, instead of dying, a character suffers a lingering wound, which requires time and care to heal.",
						"This system also works to avoid players lying on the ground unconscious, and keeps them in the battle- which means they can keep helping, but also means they're at greater risk. This means that although players will stay conscious longer, they're also more susceptible to being knocked out of the battle entirely, as enemies will continue attacking them. This is {@i probably} okay- in the worst case it's not that different from being stabbed to death while unconscious anyway.",
						"Negative hit points is a ruleset that will need to be watched carefully. In theory, the goal is to incentivize healing players who are at low hit points to give them a 'buffer' against negative hp, and to prevent low amounts of healing from being able to easily reset death saves (which is a large reason why 5e death saves are so non-threatening). In practice, negative hp may become too negative to heal (i.e if a low hp player endures a full dragon's breath), given 5e's rather conservative approach toward healing. We'll see if it becomes a problem."
