Often going about in guises, her true form is supposedly that of an old crone\u2013though it seems that if any mortals have personally seen it, none have lived to tell the tale.",

She also likes to collect bits from the effects of those that she interacts with (such as her tattoo of an upside down chicken leg, the symbol of Baba Yaga) and enjoys knowing that she has important information on so many powerful creatures.",
					"Changeable yet stubborn, as many shaped by the fey often are, Tasha's disposition can be difficult to describe. While she is often self-serving, she has no qualms accomplishing much good or evil, following whatever course of action suits her plans and mannerisms at the time. Indeed, while she has dealt with devils and worked with demons (with a noted preference for abyssal creatures) she has also been known to ally herself with angels and other beings of the upper planes.",
					"Having done many covert, cunning, and devious things, Tasha is known by many and feared by even more. Gifted with the secrets of immortality, likely by Baba Yaga, Tasha has been intimately involved in numerous important events throughout the history of many worlds. She has cursed and blessed many figures, places, and items, both from her time adventuring as a mortal and through otherwise moving upon the various realities in a multitude of ways. Eventually, she changed her appellation to Iggwilv\u2014a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired. Those who are aware of her history and her incredible power understand that they only know a fraction of what she has done, and expect to see her involved in future pivotal points as well.",
					"Some have noted that as brilliant as Tasha is, there are some things that take her by surprise even now, a notion that she seems to generally enjoy. This undoubtedly stems from the fey influence in her upbringing, which emphasizes the thrill in both giving and receiving in jokes and tricks, and it is a known fact that Tasha could have a higher Intelligence if she wanted to. At the very least, there is a popular legend that says that she has more than one spare tome of clear thought lying around somewhere.",

If by some chance an adventurer does come into contact with one of her spellbooks, it should be noted that it is certainly only a copy, and likely an abridged one at that. Her comprehensive spellbook is surely hidden away on some transitional plane that only she can access, and likely one that only she knows about."

If the miniloth feels socially threatened by other small and relatively insignificant creatures, then the miniloth will likely be spurred into taking greater lengths to win the superiors' attention and acknowledgement, drawing strength from the idea that they will be acclaimed above all the others in the end. But if the perceived threat comes from a creature that the miniloth fears it can never surpass, then the miniloth's attention-seeking tendencies turn to vile hatred, and the miniloth never forgets the spurning that it feels it has received.

As much as a miniloth wants to be praised in the moment, it has the presence of mind to acknowledge consistency and eventuality so long as they are expected, but will not remain in a situation where it does not see a reward as an eventual likelihood. While the exact terms that spell the loss of a miniloth seem to depend on the individual miniloth to some degree, the most prominent factor appears to be whether or not there are other more powerful servants available. The presence of potentially more useful minions raises the possibility, in the mind of the miniloth, that it will be overlooked in favor of other alternatives. This causes them to be highly suspicious and constantly on edge, though they may not actually leave for some time."
